# wp-cfg-so-good
#### my webpack config is better than yours. lol probably not

* LESS or SASS. you choose
* minified if you want. or not
* livereload is included, if you're into that

some sample files are in there demo-ing LESS and ES6 functionality

\* thank you to https://github.com/jasondawson for helping with the ES6 promise plugin issue, which actually isn't really a problem if you are using Node 4+, haha, but if you really don't want to use new Node, go ahead and uncomment that plugin line and make sure you npm installed es6-promise
